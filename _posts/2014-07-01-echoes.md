Our product Echoes is a tool targeted at content and social media agencies,iimproving the process of approval of content between client and agency

Content is organized into deliveries by the agency and sent to the client for approval via a link containing an identifying token. Thanks to this the onboarding is extremely low friction for the client, thus easy to implement for the agency.

Comments and approvals are centralized which provides a more efficient workflow as well as a history of revisions and feedback.
