Loxy is a provider of high quality technical textiles. We’ve helped with a series of campaigns that showcases different aspects of Loxy’s product line-up. Just not integrating with their existing CMS and existing codebase but also updating the build process to optimize and streamline the delivery solving problems such as old versions of stylesheets staying in cache.

The cases follow a common mold but each one has it’s own unique features. Be it a small animation, parallax scrolling effect or tooltips.
