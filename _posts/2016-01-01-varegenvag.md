Vår egen väg (our own way) is a celebration of the soccer team BK Häcken’s the 75 year anniversary. A showcase of the most important moments of the team’s history, each moment given a full screen with either video, audio or a written account.

We were tasked with implementing the site which serves as the base for the campaign.

To navigate the site’s slideshow the user uses gestures on touch screens, scrolling and clicking on desktops. One of the main challenges was getting the interaction right on multiple devices as scroll and swipe behaviours varies greatly.

Each moment was published on facebook and the comments are pulled automatically and shown as a comment on the moment.
