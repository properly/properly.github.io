A platform for online contests. With Mosh you can easily configure and publish a contest to a website. The setup is intuitive and edits are made directly into a visualization of the site. Complete with administration tools for moderation and publishing winners. Due to changes in local legislation Mosh is no longer available in its original form, but is still used as a technical platform for tailor-made contests.
